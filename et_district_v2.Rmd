This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```
```{r}
districts = read_csv("./data/districts.csv")
districts
```
There are 146 rows and 27 columns in districts.

Q2. Notice that the first row corresponds to the whole State of Tennessee. Remove this row and save the result back to districts.

```{r}
districts = districts[-1, ]
head(districts)
```

### Q3. How many districts have a proficiency rate of at least 80% for both alg_1 and eng_1?

```{r}
districts%>%filter(alg_1 >= 80 & eng_1 >= 80)
```

```{r}
count(districts%>%filter(alg_1 >= 80 & eng_1 >= 80))
```
There are 13 districts.


### Q4. How many districts have a proficiency rate less than 50% for either alg_1 or eng_1?
```{r}
districts%>%filter(alg_1 < 50  | eng_1 < 50)
```
```{r}
count(districts%>%filter(alg_1 < 50  | eng_1 < 50))
```

There are 8 districts. 


### Q5.Which district has the lowest graduation rate?
```{r}
districts%>%filter(grad == min(districts$grad, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  select(system_name, grad)
```
Tennessee School for Blind has the lowest graduation rate. 


### Q6.  Within the Mid Cumberland region, which district has the highest ACT composite?
```{r}
districts%>%filter(region == 'Mid Cumberland')%>%
  filter(act_composite == max(act_composite, na.rm = TRUE))%>%
  select(system_name, act_composite)
```

### Q7. Create a histogram showing the distribution of graduation rates. What can you say about this distribution?
```{r}
ggplot(districts, aes(grad)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = 'blue', color = 'black')+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 100, 10))
  
``` 
Most graduation rates fall between 80-100%. There is one outlier with a graduation rate 11%.

### Q8. Create a scatter plot to compare alg_1 proficiency rates to alg_2 rates. What do you notice? 
###     Facet this plot by region. Does anything stand out when you facet the plots?


```{r}
ggplot(districts) +
  geom_point(aes(alg_1, alg_2), color = 'blue') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 100, 10))
```
The scatter plot shows there is a strong correlation between alg_1 and alg_2 proficiency rates. 


```{r}
ggplot(districts) + 
  geom_point(aes(alg_1, alg_2, color = factor(region))) +
  facet_wrap((.~region), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
```
The scatter plots show Southwest/Memphis shows the strongest positive correlation.Southeast shows the weakest correlation.
Upper Cumberland shows a non-linear trend. 


### Q9. Create a bar chart showing the total enrollment by region. 
###     Which region has the highest total enrollment? Which has the smallest?



```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
p = ggplot(districts, aes(x=region, y=enrollment, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

p + coord_flip() 
  
  
```

Reordering by enrollment

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
p = ggplot(districts, aes(x = reorder(region, +enrollment), y=enrollment, fill = region)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")

p + coord_flip() 

```
upper cumberland and southwest memphis do not get in order. 
Mid Cumberland has the highest enrollment, Northwest has the lowest enrollment. 

### Q10. When creating this bar chart you may have noticed that some districts have missing enrollment values. 
###      For how many districts is this the case?

```{r}

sum(is.na(districts$enrollment))

```

```{r}
districts%>%filter(is.na(enrollment))%>%group_by(region, system_name)%>%tally()
```
### Q11. What is the mean graduation rate across all districts? 
###      What might be wrong with using just the regular mean to assess average graduation rates?

```{r}
mean(districts$grad, na.rm = TRUE)

```
Enrollment can affect graduation rate, schools with smaller enrollment are easily influenced by dropouts, so have smaller graduation rates which may skew data downwards.

### Q12. Redo the previous question but use a weighted average (weighted.mean) graduation across all districts, weighing by enrollment. 
###      How much does this change your answer? 
###      Can you explain using the data the reason for the big change from using the mean?

```{r}
weighted.mean(districts$grad, dplyr::coalesce(districts$enrollment,0), na.rm=TRUE)
```
